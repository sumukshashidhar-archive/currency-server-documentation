## Why Next.js over Create React App

While Create React App may give you a good starting point for building React projects, building production grade, scalable React applications quickly becomes difficult to manage. This is where a framework like Next.js comes in. I chose Next.js mainly because of:

1. Much better performance
   1. Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
   2. Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
   3. Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
2. Superior developer experience
   1. Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
   2. Development environment with Fast Refresh support
   3. Fully extendable
3. Deployment on Vercel
   1. Vercel has extremely fast build times, so the website does not have to go down for maintanence for too long.
   2. Vercel has detailed analytics support for websites built with Next.js
   3. Vercel's dashboard is clean, minimal, and extremely simple to use.
