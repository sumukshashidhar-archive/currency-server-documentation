## What this is

Welcome to the Peer Admit Documentation and Blog Site.

Here, we seek to provide documentation to our API and Blog Post Updates so that you're kept in the loop.

Peer Admit is online service that seeks to simplify the college admissions process. We focus especially on international students. We do not charge _huge_  sums of money, that other agencies do.

I went through the entire college admissions process and found it to be pretty hectic.

## Feature Set

This is more of an impromptu project that we felt has some real world potential. At the moment, we aim to provide the following features

- A _dirt-cheap_ essay review service
- A _free_ peer-to-peer essay review service
- A platform to obtain insight from current international students and others familiar with the process in general

## Contact

We would love to hear from you. To contact me, you can email me at [firstname]@sumukshashidhar.com with any suggesstions or comments that you might have going forward.
